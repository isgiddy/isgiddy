## Isabelle Giddy

Scientist 

I am a physical oceanographer who studies ocean turbulence from the submeso- to dissipation scales. I primarily use observations from sensors mounted on autonomous vehicles like gliders. I am currently a VR International Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Gothenburg in which I research wind-wave driven mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. My PhD research focused on upper ocean turbulence in the Weddell Gyre. I am active in the open source development of Best Practices for glider observations (https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity) and glider processing software ( https://glidertools.readthedocs.io).
